**Design, test, and deploy Agent Skills through a visual, AI-assisted workflow.**

uberSKILLS replaces manual `SKILL.md` authoring with a structured editor, multi-model testing sandbox, and one-click deployment to your agent's skills directory.

## What is uberSKILLS?

Creating [Agent Skills](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) today is entirely manual -- authors hand-write YAML frontmatter and markdown instructions, with no built-in way to preview, validate, or test a skill before deploying it.

uberSKILLS is an open-source web application that provides an integrated authoring environment purpose-built for the SKILL.md format, with deploy support for Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and OpenClaw:

- **Skills Library** -- Browse, search, filter, and manage all your skills in one place
- **AI-Assisted Creation** -- Describe what you want in natural language; get a complete SKILL.md draft
- **Structured Editor** -- Edit metadata, instructions, and files with real-time validation and auto-save
- **Multi-Model Testing** -- Test skills against any model on OpenRouter with streaming responses and metrics
- **Export & Deploy** -- One-click deploy to Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, or OpenClaw, or export as zip
- **Import** -- Bulk-import existing skills from directories or zip archives
- **Version History** -- Every change is versioned; browse and compare past versions

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Monorepo | Turborepo + pnpm |
| Framework | Next.js 15 (App Router) |
| UI | shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS v4 |
| Database | SQLite + Drizzle ORM |
| AI SDK | Vercel AI SDK + OpenRouter provider |
| AI Provider | OpenRouter (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Llama, etc.) |
| Logging | Pino (JSON in production, pino-pretty in development) |
| Language | TypeScript (strict) |
| Testing | Vitest + Playwright |
| Linting | Biome |

## Quickstart

Run uberSKILLS with a single command — no cloning, no setup:

```bash
npx uberskills
```

That's it. On first run it will automatically set up everything (~2 minutes), then start the server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Your data is stored at `~/.uberskills/data/` and persists across runs.

### Options

```
--port <number>    Port to run on (default: 3000)
--host <string>    Host to bind to (default: localhost)
--data-dir <path>  Custom data directory (default: ~/.uberskills/data/)
--reset            Delete cached install and re-setup
-d, --debug        Enable debug log level
```

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 20
- **git** — available in PATH

### Development Setup

If you want to contribute or run from source:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/uberskillsdev/uberskills.git
cd uberskills

# Install dependencies (pnpm is enabled via corepack)
corepack enable
pnpm install

# Start the development server
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). On first launch the app will automatically:

1. Create the `data/` directory and SQLite database
2. Run Drizzle migrations to initialize the schema
3. Generate an encryption secret at `data/.secret`
4. Open the Settings page prompting for an OpenRouter API key

No Docker, no Postgres, no signup required.

## Available Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `pnpm dev` | Start the development server on port 3000 |
| `pnpm build` | Build all packages and the web app for production |
| `pnpm lint` | Run Biome linting across the entire monorepo |

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | No | `file:data/uberskills.db` | SQLite database file path |
| `ENCRYPTION_SECRET` | No | Auto-generated | AES-256 key for encrypting the API key. Generated on first run at `data/.secret` if not set |
| `PORT` | No | `3000` | Development server port |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | No | `info` | Pino log level (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`, `silent`) |
